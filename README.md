# Guess Number
This is a single player game where you play against a bot(robot). 
The robot Bobot plays the higher-lower number guessing game with you. The computer pick a number between 0-100, you and Bobot tries to guess what it is. You guess first, after that Bobot guess. Each time you guess, the computer will tell you whether the number you guess is higher or lower than the answer. The first one that guess the number as the computer have picked wins the game!
